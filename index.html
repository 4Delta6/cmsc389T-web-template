                    Hello, my name is Keith Lee and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and A Math Minor at the University of 
                    Maryland - College Park. During my time as a SWE intern at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, I focused on automating 
                    the compliance auditing processes to a networking standard in Python as well as creating virtual testing environments with 
                    Cisco Modeling Lab. On the side, I worked with other interns to develop a full-stack application that showcased our 
                    implemetation of signal encoding and decoding to send data between 2 software defined radios using Vue.js, Flask, Axios, and Python.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from my work experience, I have completed several projects. I reverse engineered a chat server using tcpdump and Wireshark 
                    to analyze the TCP stream of bytes and decode custom headers for each chat command for a chat client. With each command structure, 
                    I was able re-create the chat server with full functionality in Rust. I also re-created the Linux File System and Makefile using 
                    C, GDB, and Valgrind. The file system supported the basic functionality of touch, cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, and rm.

                    <h2>Reverse Engineering Chat Server</h2>
                    <p>
                        I utilized tcp dump in conjunction with Wireshark to capture packets sent from a chat client to a chat server. 
                        By analyzing packets based on each chat command and different combinations of input, I was able to decode the 
                        commands header structure. The structure was typically 3 bytes of padding, 1 byte for the size of the message, 
                        3 bytes to represent a constant/server identifier, then x bytes for the data payload which was typically split into 
                        1 byte for argument length then the data. With this structure, I was able to recreate the chat servers full 
                        functionality in Rust.
                        <br><br>
                        In Rust, I was able to utilize ARCs, Mutexes, and Threads to handle multiple clients at once to provide the
                        functionality of direct messaging, joining/leaving chat rooms, listing out the users in a chat room/entire server, 
                        and changing your nickname.

                    <h2>Compliance Automation</h2>
                    <p>
                        I worked with a small agile team to design and develop a proof of concept to test the feasibility of 
                        automating compliance checking to a specific standard [Standard redacted due to NDA]. My team and I utilized regular expressions 
                        and developed data structures to try to automate compliance checking to each standard given a set of limited information in Python. 
                        Through my understanding of Cisco Products as well as various networking topics such as ACLs, BGP, IP, etc, we were able to deliver 
                        a report of our findings on time and on budget. I also created a test-bed of networks in Cisco Modeling Lab to simulate how our product 
                        would be deployed given some semi-realistic router configurations.

                        • Designed a robust file system and makefile using custom structs and pointers <br>
                        • Implemented 6 fundamental Linux commands (touch, cd, ls, pwd, mkdir,rm)
